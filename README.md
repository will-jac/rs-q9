Jack:
The midterm should be individual, with optional collaboration.
Time period should be two weeks, to allow time for somewhat complex development and allow students to perform to the best of their abilities.
The midterm should require the use of git.

Hope:
The midterm should allow us to demonstrate our proficiency in use case diagrams, activity digrams, and sequence diagrams.

The midterm should allow us to demonstrate our proficiency in creating story boards.

Cory:
Midterm preference would be individual work.
Time requirments would be 1-2 week time range. With a longer time period this allows for a student to complete the assignment without having to neglect other coursework. If a student has to learn a new peice of software such as XD the time period gives the student ample time to learn the new software and finsih the assignment.

The use of version control such as git as jack suggested is a good requirment.

Chris:
An individual midterm that can be completed in a two week time span and submitted via Git. Primary topics for the exam should resemble all of the in-class asignments we have completed. Some potential concepts are Actors/Type/Description charts, Step/Actors/Action charts, interface designs, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams.
